<h1>Raspberry Cream Brown Betty</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>This particular recipe is one way of making a dish that can be made many different ways.  We will be using challah or brioche, which is best accompanied by ommitting the 2 tbsp sugar when preparing the bread cubes.
     <br><br>
   The pastry cream for this dish requires advance preparation; this recipe's pastry cream is thinner than the classic version of the dish, but will thicken into a custard during the baking process!
