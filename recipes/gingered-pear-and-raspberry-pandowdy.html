     <li>3 tbsp plus 1 tbsp (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar</li>
     <li>1/2 tsp fine sea salt</li>
     <li>10 tbsp (5 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>

</ul></p>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

<p><ol>
     <h3>Fruit Filling:</h3>
     <li>Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Butter a 9" cast-iron skillet or 9" deep-dish pie pan.</li>
     <li>To make the fruit filling, rub the sugar, cornstarch and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
     <li>Add pears and lemon juice and toss until evenly coated.</li>
     <li>Gently fold in the raspberries, then transfer the fruit to the prepared pan.</li>
     <li>Distribute butter atop the fruit.</li>
   </ol>
   <ol>
     <h3>Biscuit:</h3>
     <li>To make the biscuit, whisk the flour, 3 tbsp of the sugar, the baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
     <li>Add the butter and toss until evenly coated.</li>
     <li>Using your fingertips or a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the size of large peas.</li>
     <li>Stir in the candied ginger, then pour in the 2/3 cup buttermilk and stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened.  The dough will be crumbly, with large pieces of butter still visible.</li>
     <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured work surface and gently press the dough together, then press it into a 9" circle.  Carefully place the dough atop the fruit.</li>
     <li>Brush the dough with the 1 tbsp buttermilk, then sprinkle with the remaining 1 tbsp sugar.</li>
     <li>Bake in the lower third of the oven for 30 minutes, then turn the oven down to 350 degrees F and bake for an additional 20 minutes or until the pastry is golden and the juices are bubbly and thick.</li>
     <li>Allow to cool for 30 minutes before serving.</li>
